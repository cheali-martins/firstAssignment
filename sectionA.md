# Section A — Intro to Backend

> This section has the questions and answers of Section A of the assignment.

### 1. What is backend development and how is it different from frontend development?

Backend development is the part of a we or an app that isn't seen, unlike the frontend which can be seen and users interact with. Basically, the backend helps the web or app understand what the user wants to do. It handles things like the logic, authentication, and communication to the database.

### 2. Mention three backend programming languages.

- JavaScript
- Python
- C#

### 3. What is a server? Explain its role in backend development.

A server is a computer that listens for requests from users and sends back reponses. Basically, in Backend development, a server receives requests from users (e.g. login request), process the data (runs the logic or checks the database) and sends response back to the user.

### 4. Define an API and explain its purpose.

An API (Application Programming Interface) allows two systems or programs to communicate with each other.  
Its purpose is to allow frontend communicate with the backend.

---

### 5. What is a database and why is it important in backend systems?

A database is a place where informations such as user accounts, product lists, posts, & anything the app/web needs to remember is stored. It is like a digital filing cabinet where data is stored, organized, and easily accessed.
It is important because the backend needs persistent storage to save and retrieve data.

---

### 6. List two differences between SQL and NoSQL databases.

- SQL databases use tables and rows just like a spreadhseet while NoSQL uses collections, documents, or key-value structures.
- SQL is structured and uses fixed schemas while NoSQL is flexible and has a dynamic schema.


---

### 7. What is a backend framework? Mention one example.

A backend framework provides tools and structures that helps developers build the backend (server-side) of an application faster and easier.  
Example: Express.js.

---

### 8. Explain what HTTP is and why it is important.

HTTP (Hypertext Transfer Protocol) is the communication protocol used between clients (web browsers) and servers.  
It is important because it defines how data is requested and delivered over the web. So it is like a bridge that lets the frontend talk to the backend.

---

### 9. Mention two responsibilities of a backend developer.

- Building and maintaining servers and APIs.
- Managing databases and server logic.

---

### 10. What does CRUD stand for? Explain each word.

CRUD stands for Create, Read,Update, Delete. These are the four basic actions one can do with data in a backend system.

- **C**reate → Add new data to the database (e.g. register a new user).
- **R**ead → Fetch existing data (e.g. show a user's profile).
- **U**pdate → Modify/Change existing data (e.g. edit s user's email).
- **D**elete → Remove data (e.g. delete a user's account).

---

### 11. What is authentication and why is it important for backend applications?

Authentication is the process of verifying a user's identity.  
It is important because it protects user accounts and restricts access to sensitive data.

---

### 12. What is the difference between a GET request and a POST request?

- **GET**: Used to retrieve data from a server.
- **POST**: Used to send data to a server (e.g., submitting forms, creating new records).
